# Status Update:

Due to lack of interest in this repo by everyone originally involved but myself I decided to convert it to something more interesting to me.

I think Python is an excellent Tool Language but I am more interested in developing with C so I decided to repurpose this group to both languages and reach out to other coders I know instead of just Python coders.

SO: the upshot is that on December 1st there will be a MoCodez meeting.
